> "Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever." - Mahatma Gandhi

*Living as if we'll die tomorrow means prioritizing what truly matters, showing love, being present for beautiful moments, and stopping the wait for validation/permission to be fully ourselves. Learning as if we'll live forever is about approaching knowledge with patience and curiosity, being willing to be beginners, and recognizing that true understanding develops over decades.*

You can call me Dav, Dave or David.

I'm a software engineer excited about improving technology particularly using Rust. Thanks to Rust [Zero to Mastery](https://youtube.com/@ZeroToMastery) and [Let's Get Rusty](https://youtube.com/@letsgetrusty) videos that got me onboarded and hooked some years ago.  Here's a list of what I currently do:
- Contributing to open source and startups
- Reading a lot, mostly on Rust. I have read the entire Rust book, Async Rust, Effective Rust, Zero to Production and Computer Design and Architecture by my namesake David!
- Working as a DevRel at Superteam Nigeria
- Building personal projects using Rust to practicalize everything I'm learning
- Documenting my Rust journey on [Medium](https://medium.com/@davidjrn247) -> Follow me!
- Trying to always get better at this
