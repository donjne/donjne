# 👋🏾 Hey there, I’m David  

<img src="/avatar.png" alt="David's Avatar" width="120" style="border-radius: 50%; border: 2px solid #1CA2F1; margin-bottom: 16px;">  

I’m all about **building solutions with technology**. Whether it’s **blockchain**, **cybersecurity**, or **software development**, I’m here for the real-world impact. I write, build, hack, and sometimes break things (on purpose, of course).  

---

### 🌟 What I’m Up To  
- **Blockchain**: Building decentralized apps on Solana with tools like **Anchor**, creating NFT marketplaces, stablecoin systems, and prediction markets.  
- **Cybersecurity**: Helping people stay one step ahead of threats with **ethical hacking**, penetration testing, and secure protocol design.  
- **Writing**: Sharing what I learn—check out my guides on **cybersecurity**, **blockchain basics**, and tools like **Opta IaC**.
