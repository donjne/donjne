*Living as if we'll die tomorrow means prioritizing what truly matters, showing love, being present for beautiful moments, and stopping the wait for validation/permission to be fully ourselves. Learning as if we'll live forever is about approaching knowledge with patience and curiosity, being willing to be beginners, and recognizing that true understanding develops over decades.*

I'm a 20-year-old engineer excited about exploring the boundaries of technology. My journey began at 16 as a frontend developer, where I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through [Academind](https://academind.com). Since then, I've become proficient with React and Next.js, creating user experiences with animation libraries like Framer Motion, GSAP, and Three.js.

After working extensively with APIs, I became interested in building my own backend systems, which led me to discover Rust. I was first introduced to Rust in 2022 through courses by [Zero to Mastery](https://youtube.com/@ZeroToMastery) and [Let's Get Rusty](https://youtube.com/@letsgetrusty), which delivered that dopamine hit. Following some frustrating experiences with backend engineers and months of financial instability after turning down JavaScript opportunities, I made the decision to fully transition to backend development with Rust.

In early 2024, I completed the entire Rust Book and Async Rust book, built web servers with Actix Web for a school hackathon, and developed Solana programs with Anchor to compete in various Solana hackathons. Currently, I'm building on Solana as a Superteam member and documenting my Rust journey on [Medium](https://medium.com/@davidjrn247).

**Projects I've contributed to on Solana:**
- [ARK](https://useark.xyz)
- [Stable](https://stable.fun)
- [Chatter](https://usechatter.app)
- [Light Protocol](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/groth16-solana)
